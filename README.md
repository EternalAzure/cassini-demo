# 9th CASSINI Hackathon: Space for Healthcare

The 9th edition of the CASSINI Hackathon focuses on leveraging space technologies to tackle critical challenges related to Europeâ€™s healthcare. This event brings together coders, problem-solvers, and innovators from across Europe to develop cutting-edge solutions using space-based technologies that can transform healthcare and improve public health and well-being.

## Solution: Reduce air pollution exposure in urban areas
WHO data show that almost all of the global population (99%) breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures.

Most common air-pollution sources involve combustion, while harmful on large scale CO2 emissions are not significant health risk to humans directly. After all, our own bodies produce CO2. Unfortunately combustion processes are almost never 100% efficient and produce multitude of other chemicals and particulate matter (PM), these are shown to lead to adverse health outcomes.

Air filters keep us safe from outdoor pollutions when changed regularly. Manual status checks on these systems are expensive and some times neglected. Because we know the ventilation rate, we can calculate with satellite data when air filters need to be replaced. This improves indoor air quality and removes the need for costly manual check ups.
